# Election-Audit Summary:  
The data provided was analyzed using this script to determine not only the overall winner as well as county voting information.  In the future, this script can be altered and used to handle more candidates as well as more county information.  The new election results on a new csv file would need to be provided for an election in the future.  The path to the csv file that held the voting results would need to be updated in the script to access the intended results.  Once the correct file is accessed, the script will provide a wealth of information about the election results and be able to identify the winner.  The script is written so that any number of counties and candidates can be analyzed.
